# Personalized Learning using Big Data Analytics

This project leverages PySpark to develop a personalized learning system based on student performance data. The dataset includes variables such as student ID, gender, study time, and grades (G1, G2, G3). Using Sparkâ€™s capabilities, the dataset is first cleaned and processed, with missing values handled through imputation. Feature engineering is applied to calculate an average grade and encode categorical features like gender and study time.

KMeans clustering is utilized to group students into clusters based on their performance. These clusters are then used to provide personalized learning resource recommendations. The project concludes with a visual analysis of the clustering results, demonstrating patterns in student performance and offering tailored learning materials for each group. This approach showcases the potential of data-driven, personalized educational experiences aimed at improving student outcomes.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **PySpark**: Distributed data processing, data cleaning, and feature engineering.
- **KMeans Clustering**: Grouping students based on grades and study time.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization and scatter plots.
- **Pandas**: DataFrame conversion for easier manipulation and plotting.
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**: Interactive execution environment.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following key columns:

- `student_id`: Unique identifier for each student.
- `gender`: Gender of the student (categorical).
- `study_time`: Study time categorized into ranges (e.g., "<2 hours").
- `G1`, `G2`, `G3`: Grades from three assessment periods.

Additional transformations:
- Created `average_grade` from G1, G2, G3.
- Encoded categorical features (gender, study_time) into numeric format.
- Handled null values by filling with 0.
